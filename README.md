### ✅ Features

- **Java + TestNG** based test execution  
- **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern  
- **Explicit Waits Utility**  
- **Cross-browser support (Edge, Chrome, etc.)**  
- **Log4j2 logging**  
- **Allure Reporting**  
- **Data-driven testing using JSON & Excel**  
- **CI-ready with GitHub Actions**  
- **Scalable directory structure**  
- **Custom Hooks & Listeners for screenshots and logs**  
- **Environment-based execution (local, remote, headless)**

## 📂 Framework Design Highlights
- **Page Object Model (POM)** with component-based design → clean separation of Pages & reusable UI components  
- **Driver Management** → ThreadLocal WebDriver for safe parallel tests  
- **BaseTest** → unified setup/teardown for UI & API tests  
- **Utils Layer** → WaitManager, PropertyReader, JsonReader, TerminalUtils  
- **Assertions Layer** → Hard (Verification) & Soft (Validation)  
- **Reports & Logs** → Allure Reports + Log4j2 + video recording support  
- **CI/CD Ready** → Easy integration with Jenkins / GitHub Actions

## 🧪 Test Coverage Examples
✔ Register/Login user (API + UI)  
✔ Add product to cart & validate cart  
✔ Checkout & validate delivery/billing addresses  
✔ Payment flow with card information
